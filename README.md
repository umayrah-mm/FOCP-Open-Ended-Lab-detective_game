This is a console-based detective game,

INSTRUCTIONS:

Objective:
You are a detective tasked with solving the murder of Mr. Jack inside his mansion. Investigate suspects and locations to uncover the truth before your energy runs out.

How to Play:

Begin the Investigation
Press ENTER to start. Read the case details carefully. There are five suspects and five important locations inside the mansion.

Explore Locations
You can visit two locations at the start. Each visit reveals clues, but also costs energy.
You may choose to visit one or two additional locations later, but extra visits drain more energy than the first two.

Interrogate the Suspects
There are five suspects:
• Maid
• Chef
• Butler
• Gardener
• Driver

You will ask each suspect one of two questions:
• “What were you doing?” → small energy gain
• “Any grudges?” → higher energy gain

Their responses may contain truths, lies, or hints that help solve the case.

Optional Final Search
You can choose to investigate one last location if you are unsure.
Be careful: this last visit costs a large amount of energy.

Final Accusation
Select two suspects for a final interrogation.
Then make your final guess on who the real murderer is.

Energy System:
• Starting Energy: 100
• Visiting locations: decreases energy
• Asking smart questions: increases energy
• Wrong final guess: large energy loss

Endings Based on Final Energy:
• 120 or more: Excellent detective
• 80 to 119: Good work
• 50 to 79: Barely solved it

Helpful Tips:
